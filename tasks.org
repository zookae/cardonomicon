* turn structure
** TODO planner enforces costs on cards played
** TODO planner enforces actions for each card in play
** TODO planner prevents actions out of phase
** TODO planner tracks delayed or reactionary effects
** TODO actions target using deictic variables to substitute
** TODO types constrain what effects may apply to
** TODO track pools of cards in hand, deck, floor/mat -> generalize to N spaces cards move around + constraints on allowed actions by phase (assume noop if none defined)

* card definition
** TODO phase constraints
** TODO costs of actions
** TODO stats - health, cost to play
** TODO attributes for actions - attack, target types
